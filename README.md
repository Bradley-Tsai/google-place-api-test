# Google Place APIs for Reviews
This is a simple project for myself retrieving reviews from a restaurant called "一品山西刀削麵".

## Usage
The Python codes in this repository are exetremely simple. Here are some steps for your understanding to use them.  

Steps:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
2. Generate an API key from GCP.
3. Place the API key string to the nearby_search.py and place_details.py
4. Run those .py files.
5. Check your result in reviews.json

The variables ```lat``` and ```lon``` can be found using Google Maps.
